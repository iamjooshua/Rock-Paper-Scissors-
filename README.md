# Rock-Paper-Scissors - Zuri Training

I worked on a Rock-Paper-Scissors game which was a task at the Zuri's Training. The aim is to create a simple version of this game with Python where one player will be controlled by the computer and the other player controlled by you - the user (i.e CPU vs Player) using the **random** python module and its **choice** method.

Here are some resources which will help you understand the game
